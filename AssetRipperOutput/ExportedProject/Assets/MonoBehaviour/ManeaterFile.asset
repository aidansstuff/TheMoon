  displayText: "Maneater\n\nSigurd's danger level: 1000%\n\nyOU WERE LIKE A SON\n\nScientific name: Periplaneta clamorus\n\nThe Maneater has been linked to a genus of cockroaches known as Periplaneta. It was first nicknamed by workers of the Caswella Mine, one of many copper mines along the asteroid belt of Lepus, in 1951. The Caswella Mine had begun to languish since the end of wartime and would soon close after operating for twelve years; working conditions had worsened long before the rumor of the Maneater had begun to spread, and as a result, it was not taken seriously by the higher ups or media at the time. On June 23 of that year, however, an eviscerated corpse was rescued from the lowest level of Caswella Mine. \n\nIt was later identified as Brett Goldent, a senior mining operator. Autopsy recorded the death an accident resulting from faulty equipment. However the story became a sensation, and the Maneater rose up as a famous myth until six years later, when it would be first recorded in the DEEP57 cave expedition headed by Simon Goldent to put to rest the mystery of his father's death. This was a revelation to the scientific world, as it is now known as the largest troglobite (cave-dwelling species). A creature of this size confined to underground caves was thought impossible. Simon Goldent, who had seeked to disprove the myth, described his discovery as \"traumatic.\"\n\nPeriplaneta clamorus is thought to live off of mainly plant debri and animal carcasses, both of which can be carried into the caves by running water. It seems to have never developed the instinctive fear of larger predators while living underground. Thus, as a larva it may be fascinated or indifferent to human presence. However, as larvae, they can react fearfully to loud noises or to the sight of blood and injury. Some researchers have observed the larvae to show signs of loneliness.\n\nBeing unhappy or afraid seems to exacerbate Periplaneta clamorus' symptoms of growth. Its metamorphosis is remarkably sudden and is a dangerous phenomenon to observe. The most telling sign that a larva is approaching metamorphosis is an excretion of an acidic, foamy liquid at its lower jaw; this substance is believed to be a catalyst and exits its body in large quantities once metamorphosis begins.\n\nAn adult can move incredibly fast and is capable of creating loud noise by clicking its mandibles at high frequency. In an encounter with Periplaneta clamorus, recommended procedure is to back away slowly and keep your distance, as it seems to wait for you to approach and avoids line of sight. Stopping and exhaling suddenly while arching its legs backwards is a sign that an adult is entering chase. God help[ you\n\n\n\n"
