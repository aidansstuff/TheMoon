  displayText: "Kidnapper fox\n\nSigurd's danger level: 80% GOOD JOB he gets an A+ in creep schcool\n\nScientific name: Vulpes raptor\nA large mammal of the family Canidae, the Kidnapper fox has many unique biological traits. Two of these are its horizontal jaw and unique skull shape giving it a great biting strength, and its long, frog-like tongue which can reach even twice the length of its spindly body. They are solitary hunters and mate for life.\n\nKidnapper foxes have a very long, bushy neck and tail with a more reddish coloration, which is thought to blend in well with the numerous Vain Shroud, where it can almost always be found hiding and waiting for prey. The Kidnapper fox and Vain shrouds together form one of the most infamously known and unique mutualistic relationships between two invasive species. Together they continue to spread across planetary systems, stowing away on large spacecraft. Excluding a select few nature preserves, the ITDA has issued a kill-on-sight order for the Kidnapper fox and Vain shrouds due to their impact on ecosystems. \n\nThe Kidnapper fox earns its name from its aggressive yet timid and territorial behaviour, preferring to finish off prey out of sight and usually in the comfort of the Vain shrouds. It usually chooses to lie low and wait for things to come its way. But if it grows restless, it can use its long, sticky tongue to snatch its prey from great distances and drag them as far as it needs. If there are Vain shrouds in your area, carry a weapon and do not stray far from others; its tongue is quite soft and fragile and can be struck easily, forcing it to stop an assault. Today there are relatively few human deaths attributed to Kidnapper foxes per year, and most victims are unsupervised children or adults hiking alone.\n\n\n"
