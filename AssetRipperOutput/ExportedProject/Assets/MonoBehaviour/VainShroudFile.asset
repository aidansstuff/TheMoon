  displayText: "Vain Shrouds\n\nSigurd's danger level:  THIS IS NT A CREATURE.\n\nScientific name: Phlebodium ruber\nVain Shrouds, also commonly referred to as Vains, are a type of rhizomatous fern of the family Polypodiaceae. In ideal conditions, Vain Shrouds' fronds can reach a height of 8 feet, though they average 6'11'', and are 30-50 centimeters wide. Their roots are unusually large, and they are somewhat SOMEWHATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTprickly. \n\nWith their aggressive reproduction and remarkable size, they take up a lot of space, making visibility difficult, and are difficult to remove. They crowd out healthy plants and offer little nutritional value. They are also highly flammable. A strongly correlated mutualistic relationship has been observed between Vain Shrouds and the Kidnapper Fox, and for this reason Vains are a danger when they are allowed to expand to great numbers. Due to this and their other harmful effects on many ecosystems and agriculture, Vains have been classified as a noxious weed by the ITDA since 2147.\n\n\n\nTheir planet of origin is unknown, and they were first recorded by plant researcher Alex Kurt in CoRoT-7b in 2143 before being found on the other side of its same interplanetary system just weeks later. A common myth is that the Vains were first spread across planets due to their mild hallucinogenic properties when ingested, but their history is shrouded in mystery.\n\nWAKE UP.. THE COMPAN Y LACED THE DROP POD WITH THE SEEDS,THEY UPSELL US FOR WEED KILLER CAUSE THEY KNOW WWE HATE THIS CHERRY RED MENACE sorry caps\n\n"
